# üõí E-Commerce Database Design

Welcome to our Peer Group Assignment repository for **E-commerce Database Design**. This project aims to demonstrate effective database design using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a normalized SQL schema to support a flexible and scalable e-commerce platform.

---

## üìå Objective

To collaboratively design and implement a relational database schema that supports a real-world e-commerce application including:

- Products and Variations
- Brands and Categories
- Images, Colors, and Sizes
- Product Attributes and Types

---

## üìê Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

We used [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) to design our ERD. It outlines the relationships between all entities required in an e-commerce platform.
